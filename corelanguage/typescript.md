# TypeScript Key Concepts

## 1. Type Annotations

TypeScript allows you to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values to catch errors early and provide better tooling.

---

## 2. Interfaces

Interfaces define the shape of an object by specifying required properties and their types, helping ensure consistent structure.

---

## 3. Types and Type Aliases

You can create custom types using type aliases to represent unions, intersections, or complex types for better code readability.

---

## 4. Enums

Enums are a way to define a set of named constants, making code more readable and less error-prone by avoiding magic numbers or strings.

---

## 5. Classes

TypeScript supports ES6 classes with type annotations and access modifiers (public, private, protected) to organize code with encapsulation.

---

## 6. Generics

Generics enable you to write reusable and flexible components or functions that work with any data type while preserving type safety.

---

## 7. Union and Intersection Types

- Union types allow a variable to be one of several types, improving flexibility.
- Intersection types combine multiple types into one, ensuring the variable satisfies all combined types.

---

## 8. Optional Chaining and Nullish Coalescing

- Optional chaining safely accesses deeply nested properties without errors if an intermediate value is null or undefined.
- Nullish coalescing provides default values only when a variable is null or undefined, unlike traditional OR operators.

---

## 9. Modules and Imports

TypeScript organizes code into modules that can export and import functionality, improving maintainability and scope management.

---

## 10. Type Assertions

Type assertions allow you to explicitly tell TypeScript to treat a value as a specific type, useful when you know more about the type than the compiler.

---

# Summary

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static typing, which improves code quality, helps catch errors early, and provides better developer tooling and maintainability.
