# AI Agents: Overview and Important Concepts

## What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is a software system that perceives its environment through sensors, processes the information, and acts autonomously to achieve specific goals.

It can:

- Make decisions based on input data
- Learn from experience
- Interact with users or other systems

## Types of AI Agents

1. **Simple Reflex Agents**

   - Act only on current input
   - No memory of past inputs

2. **Model-Based Agents**

   - Maintain internal state to track environment
   - Make decisions based on model

3. **Goal-Based Agents**

   - Take actions to achieve specific goals
   - Use planning algorithms

4. **Utility-Based Agents**

   - Evaluate options based on utility functions
   - Choose actions that maximize overall utility

5. **Learning Agents**
   - Learn and improve performance from experience
   - Use machine learning or reinforcement learning

## Key Components of an AI Agent

- **Sensors:** Collect data from the environment
- **Actuators:** Perform actions on the environment
- **Agent Function:** Maps perceptions to actions
- **Performance Measure:** Defines success criteria

## Popular AI Agent Applications

- Chatbots and virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa)
- Game-playing agents (e.g., chess AI)
- Autonomous vehicles and drones
- Recommendation systems
- Robotics and automation

## Steps to Build a Basic AI Agent

1. **Define the Problem & Goal**  
   What should the agent achieve?

2. **Design Input Mechanism (Perception)**  
   How will the agent receive data? (text, images, sensors)

3. **Decision Making Process**  
   Use rules, machine learning models, or reinforcement learning algorithms.

4. **Define Actions**  
   What actions can the agent perform?

5. **Implement Feedback Loop**  
   Optionally, allow the agent to learn and improve based on feedback.

## Important Concepts to Understand

- **Agent Architectures** (reactive, deliberative, hybrid)
- **Search Algorithms** (DFS, BFS, A\*) for decision making
- **Reinforcement Learning** (Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for conversational agents
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)** for modeling decision making under uncertainty

## Interview Tips: AI Agents

- Be ready to explain different types of agents and their use cases
- Understand how agents perceive, decide, and act
- Know the difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in agents
- Explain simple algorithms used in decision making and learning
- Give real-world examples where AI agents are used
