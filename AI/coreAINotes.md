## 1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence such as:

- **Reasoning**: Drawing conclusions from data or facts.
- **Learning**: Improving performance based on experience.
- **Perception**: Interpreting sensory inputs (e.g., vision, speech).
- **Decision Making**: Selecting best actions in complex scenarios.

**Types of AI:**

| Type       | Description                                         | Examples                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Narrow AI  | AI focused on specific tasks                        | Voice assistants, spam filters     |
| General AI | AI with human-level cognitive ability (theoretical) | Human-like reasoning (future goal) |
| Super AI   | Surpasses human intelligence (conceptual)           | Advanced hypothetical AI           |

## 2. Core AI Areas

### a. Machine Learning (ML)

- ML enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.
- **Types of ML:**

  - **Supervised Learning**: Trains on labeled data (input-output pairs).  
    _Example:_ Email spam detection (emails labeled spam/not spam).
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.  
    _Example:_ Customer segmentation in marketing.
  - **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Learns optimal actions via rewards from interaction with environment.  
    _Example:_ Game-playing AI like AlphaGo.

- **Common Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Means Clustering.

### b. Deep Learning (DL)

- A subset of ML using **neural networks** with multiple layers (deep neural networks).
- Excels in recognizing patterns in unstructured data like images, audio, and text.
- Types of Neural Networks:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Used for image recognition.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Used for sequence data like time series or language.
  - **Transformer Networks:** Use attention mechanisms; basis of models like GPT and BERT.

---

### c. Neural Networks (NN)

- Inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (“neurons”).
- Each neuron receives inputs, applies weights, biases, and activation functions.
- Learning involves adjusting weights to minimize error (using backpropagation and gradient descent).
