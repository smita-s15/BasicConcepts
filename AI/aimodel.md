# Step-by-Step AI Task Approach (Production & Interview Ready)

## 1. Understand the Problem Clearly

- Clarify the goal (prediction, classification, recommendation, summarization, anomaly detection, etc.).
- Define success criteria and primary metric(s) (e.g., F1, RMSE, NDCG).
- Ask clarifying questions: "What's the success criteria? What are latency and throughput needs? Where is the data?"

## 2. Gather and Understand Data

- Identify datasets and access paths (internal logs, APIs, third-party, public).
- Check data types (text, image, audio, tabular), volume, and label availability.
- Consider privacy and governance (PII, consent, GDPR).

## 3. Data Preprocessing & Exploration

- Clean data (dedupe, fill/drop missing, correct formats).
- Perform EDA (distributions, correlations, outliers, imbalance).
- Build reproducible preprocessing pipelines (scikit-learn Pipeline, tf.data).
- Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, OpenCV, spaCy/NLTK.

## 4. Feature Engineering & Storage

- Engineer features and validate their predictive power.
- Store features in a feature store (e.g., Feast) or ensure transform parity between training and serving.
- Use augmentation/synthetic data if needed.

## 5. Model Selection

- Start with a baseline (Logistic, RandomForest, XGBoost).
- Use deep learning (CNN, RNN, Transformers) for images/text when required.
- Consider pre-trained models and transfer learning for faster convergence.

## 6. Model Training & Validation

- Split data (train/val/test), use cross-validation if data is small.
- Track experiments with MLflow, Weights & Biases (W&B).
- Use hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch, RandomSearch, Optuna).
- Ensure reproducibility (set seeds, containerize env).

## 7. Evaluation & Optimization

- Evaluate with appropriate metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, RMSE, AUC, etc.
- Examine confusion matrices, calibration, and class-wise performance.
- Perform fairness/bias audits and explainability (SHAP/LIME).

## 8. Packaging, Testing & Model Registry

- Package the model artifact with versioning (MLflow, S3, or artifact store).
- Write unit tests & integration tests for preprocessing and inference.
- Register models in a model registry for tracking and rollback.

## 9. Deployment & Serving

- Choose serving pattern: real-time (REST/gRPC), streaming, or batch.
- Containerize (Docker) and orchestrate (Kubernetes). Use TF Serving or TorchServe if applicable.
- Use blue/green or canary deploys and autoscaling.
- Implement auth, rate limiting, and input validation.

## 10. Monitoring & Maintenance

- Monitor latency, throughput, error rates, and model metrics in production.
- Detect data drift and prediction drift; log inputs and predictions.
- Implement retrain pipelines and triggers; schedule periodic retraining if needed.
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/Stackdriver, Tecton/Feast for features, Alibi Detect for drift.

## 11. Security, Compliance & Costs

- Encrypt data in transit and at rest; manage secrets; protect PII.
- Adhere to compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA as applicable).
- Estimate compute and storage costs and monitor usage.

## 12. Product & Team Considerations

- Define clear ownership (data engineering, ML engineering, SRE, product).
- Plan user feedback loops and A/B testing for releases.
- Document model cards, runbooks, and knowledge transfer.

### Example: Deployment & Monitoring (Concise)

- Serve model via a versioned REST API behind an API gateway.
- Collect logs and metrics; set alerts for drift and performance drops.
- Use canary rollout, compare metrics, then promote or rollback.

### Quick Elevator Version (30s)

“I approach AI features by defining the business goal and success metrics, collecting & validating data, building a baseline model and iterating while tracking experiments, then packaging and deploying the best model with CI/CD and monitoring for drift, plus security and compliance. Continuous feedback and retraining keep the model reliable.”
