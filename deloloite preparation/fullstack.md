# üîå Difference Between RESTful APIs and WebSockets

| Aspect                  | RESTful APIs                                          | WebSockets                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Communication Model** | Request‚ÄìResponse (client initiates every interaction) | Full-duplex (both client & server can send data anytime)                 |
| **Protocol**            | HTTP (stateless)                                      | Persistent TCP connection (upgraded from HTTP using `ws://` or `wss://`) |
| **State**               | Stateless (each request independent)                  | Stateful (connection remains open, context maintained)                   |
| **Data Flow**           | One-way per request (client ‚Üí server ‚Üí response)      | Bi-directional (client ‚Üî server continuously)                            |
| **Best For**            | CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)        | Real-time applications (chat, notifications, gaming, stock tickers)      |
| **Overhead**            | Higher (HTTP headers in every request)                | Lower (lightweight frames after handshake)                               |
| **Scalability**         | Easier with load balancers and caching                | Harder due to long-lived connections                                     |
| **Examples**            | `GET /users/1`, `POST /orders`                        | Live chat, collaborative editing, IoT dashboards                         |
