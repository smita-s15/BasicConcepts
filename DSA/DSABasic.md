# Basic Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Concepts

## 1. Data Structures

### Arrays

- Collection of elements stored in contiguous memory.
- Fixed size (in most languages).
- Fast access by index (O(1)).

### Linked Lists

- Elements (nodes) linked using pointers.
- Types: Singly, Doubly, Circular.
- Dynamic size, efficient insertions/deletions.

### Stack

- Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
- Operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`.
- Used in function calls, expression evaluation.

### Queue

- First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
- Operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`.
- Variants: Simple queue, Circular queue, Priority queue.

### Trees

- Hierarchical data structure with nodes.
- Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Heaps.
- Used for searching, sorting, hierarchical data.

### Graphs

- Nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- Types: Directed/Undirected, Weighted/Unweighted.
- Represent networks, social connections.

### Hash Tables (Hash Maps)

- Key-value pairs with fast access (average O(1)).
- Handle collisions via chaining or open addressing.

## 2. Algorithms

### Searching

- Linear Search: O(n), sequential check.
- Binary Search: O(log n), requires sorted data.

### Sorting

- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort: O(nÂ²).
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort: O(n log n).
- Sorting arranges data in order (asc/desc).

### Recursion

- Function calling itself with smaller input.
- Base case needed to end recursion.

### Divide and Conquer

- Break problem into subproblems.
- Solve independently and combine results.
- Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort.

### Dynamic Programming

- Solves problems by caching solutions of subproblems.
- Avoids redundant work.
- Examples: Fibonacci, Knapsack problem.

### Greedy Algorithms

- Make optimal choice at each step.
- Used in optimization problems.
