# What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.  
It is widely known for its **simplicity**, **readability**, and **versatility**, making it one of the most popular languages in the world.

## Uses of Python

Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including:

- **Web Development** → Server-side applications using frameworks like Django, Flask, FastAPI
- **Software Development** → Desktop, mobile, and CLI tools
- **Data Science & AI** → Data analysis, machine learning, deep learning
- **Automation / Scripting** → Automating repetitive tasks
- **Mathematics & Scientific Computing** → Numerical calculations, simulations
- **System Scripting** → Interacting with operating systems, file handling
- **Game Development** → 2D/3D game creation with libraries like Pygame

## Python Overview

### What Can Python Do?

- Build **web applications**
- Automate **workflows** and repetitive processes
- Connect to **databases**, read/write files
- Process **big data** and perform complex mathematical operations
- Create **prototypes** quickly and develop production-ready software

### Why Python?

- **Cross-platform** → Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi
- **Easy-to-read syntax** → Resembles English, reduces learning curve
- **Concise code** → Achieve more with fewer lines of code
- **Interpreter-based** → Run code directly without compilation
- **Multi-paradigm support** → Procedural, Object-Oriented, and Functional programming styles

## Good to Know

- The latest major version is **Python 3** (Python 2 is deprecated and only receives security patches).
- Python code can be written in **any text editor** or **IDE** like Thonny, PyCharm, VS Code, NetBeans, or Eclipse.
- Huge **standard library** and **third-party ecosystem** available via `pip`.

---

## Syntax Highlights

- **Readable, clean syntax** inspired by mathematics
- Commands are **terminated by new lines** (no semicolons required)
- **Indentation** (spaces/tabs) defines code blocks instead of curly braces `{}`
- Case-sensitive (`Variable` and `variable` are different)
- Supports inline comments using `#` and multi-line strings with triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`)
