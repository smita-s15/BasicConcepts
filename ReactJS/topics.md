# Complete React.js Syllabus - Step by Step

## Step 1: React Basics

- Introduction to React
- Features of React
- Why React is used
- JSX Syntax and Rules
- Components (Functional & Class)
- Props (Passing Data, Default Props, Prop Types)
- State (setState, useState)
- Virtual DOM & Real DOM
- Rendering (Initial and Conditional Rendering)
- Event Handling (onClick, onChange, onSubmit)
- Forms Handling (Controlled & Uncontrolled)
- Lists and Keys
- Styling in React (CSS Modules, Inline, Styled Components)

## Step 2: React Hooks

- useState
- useEffect (dependencies, cleanup, multiple effects)
- useRef
- useContext
- useMemo
- useCallback
- useReducer
- Custom Hooks (Creation and Usage)
- Rules of Hooks

## Step 3: Component Lifecycle

- Mounting, Updating, Unmounting in Class Components
- Lifecycle Methods (constructor, render, componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount)
- Mapping Class Lifecycle to Hooks
- API Calls in Lifecycle Methods
- Timers and Subscriptions Cleanup

## Step 4: State Management

- Lifting State Up
- Prop Drilling Problem
- Context API (Provider, Consumer, useContext)
- Redux (Store, Actions, Reducers, Middleware)
- Redux Toolkit
- MobX (Overview)
- Zustand / Recoil (Overview)
- Debugging State (Redux DevTools, React DevTools)

## Step 5: Performance Optimization

- Reconciliation (Virtual DOM Diffing)
- Keys in Lists (Importance and Best Practices)
- Memoization Techniques (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Code Splitting and Lazy Loading (React.lazy, Suspense)
- Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders
- Performance Profiling (React DevTools Profiler)
- SSR (Server-Side Rendering) & SSG (Static Site Generation)
- Hydration and Rehydration

## Step 6: API Integration

- Fetching Data (fetch, axios)
- Async/Await and Promises
- Error Handling and Loading States
- Canceling Requests (AbortController, Axios CancelToken)
- Pagination and Infinite Scroll Implementation
- Handling Auth Tokens (JWT)
- Caching and State Management with API Data

## Step 7: React Router

- Basics of Routing
- Route Components, Link vs Anchor Tag
- useNavigate / useHistory
- Route Parameters and Query Parameters
- Nested Routes
- Protected Routes / Private Routes
- Redirects
- 404 / Not Found Handling
- Route Transition Animations (Optional)

## Step 8: Advanced Topics

- SSR vs SSG vs CSR
- Hydration & Rehydration in Server Rendered Apps
- Higher Order Components (HOCs)
- Render Props Pattern
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
- React Fiber Architecture
- Portals
- Concurrent Mode (Experimental)
- Suspense for Data Fetching
- Error Boundaries
- Context vs Redux for Advanced State Management
- React Profiler API

## Step 9: Testing in React

- Unit Testing (Jest)
- Component Testing (React Testing Library)
- Snapshot Testing
- Async Testing and Mocking API Calls
- Props and Event Testing
- Integration Testing
- End-to-End Testing Overview (Cypress / Playwright)

## Step 10: Practical / Scenario-Based Topics

- Form Handling with Validation (React Hook Form / Formik)
- Optimizing Large Lists (react-window, react-virtualized)
- State Persistence (localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB)
- Theme Implementation (Dark / Light Mode)
- Reusable Modal and Dialog Components
- Global Error Handling (Error Boundaries, Toasts)
- Authentication & Authorization Handling
- Project Structure and Folder Organization
- Environment Variables in React (.env files)
- Debugging React Applications (React DevTools, Console, Breakpoints)
- Performance Monitoring (Web Vitals, Lighthouse)
- Deployment Best Practices (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
