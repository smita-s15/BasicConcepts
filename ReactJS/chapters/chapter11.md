## Additional / Advanced & Missing React Topics

This document adds advanced concepts, practical considerations, and topics often missed in standard React notes. These are crucial for interview preparation and building production-grade applications.

---

# 1. Advanced Hooks

- `useRef` for DOM references and persisting mutable values.
- `useLayoutEffect` vs `useEffect` (synchronous vs asynchronous effect execution).
- `useImperativeHandle` to customize refs in child components.
- Custom hooks: reusable logic, dependency management, and optimization.

---

# 2. Performance Optimizations (Additional)

- Lazy loading images and assets (`loading="lazy"`).
- Avoid inline object/array creation in props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Throttling and debouncing event handlers.
- React concurrent features: `startTransition` and transitions for prioritizing updates.

---

# 3. Forms & Validation (Additional)

- Dynamic fields and conditional validations.
- Optimizing large forms with performance in mind.
- Integration with React Hook Form, Formik, or Yup.

---

# 4. Animations

- CSS transitions vs libraries: `Framer Motion`, `React Spring`.
- Route transitions and enter/exit animations.
- State-driven animations and performance considerations.

---

# 5. Internationalization (i18n)

- Libraries: `react-i18next`.
- Dynamic locale switching.
- Formatting dates, times, and numbers per locale.

---

# 6. Accessibility (a11y)

- Use semantic HTML in React components.
- ARIA attributes for modals, alerts, and custom controls.
- Keyboard navigation and focus management.
- Accessibility testing tools: `axe-core`, Lighthouse.

---

# 7. Error Handling (Advanced)

- Global API error interceptors (Axios / Fetch).
- Retry logic for failed requests.
- Logging errors to external monitoring services like Sentry or LogRocket.

---

# 8. Testing (Advanced)

- Mocking context and hooks in tests.
- Testing asynchronous UI updates (`waitFor`, `findBy*`).
- Test coverage reports and integration with CI pipelines.
- Testing custom hooks using `@testing-library/react-hooks`.

---

# 9. Security

- Prevent XSS attacks by sanitizing inputs.
- Store sensitive tokens in HttpOnly cookies rather than localStorage.
- Protect routes and API endpoints from unauthorized access.

---

# 10. Server-Side Rendering & Next.js Advanced

- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
- Dynamic routing with SSR/SSG.
- API routes in Next.js for backend integration.
- Prefetching and caching data for faster page loads.

---

# 11. Micro-Frontend & Modularization

- Code splitting by routes and features.
- Building reusable UI libraries (Storybook integration).
- Integrating multiple React apps in a single project.

---

# 12. DevOps & CI/CD Considerations

- Environment-based builds: `.env.development`, `.env.production`.
- Automated deployments: Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Actions.
- Monitoring performance and errors after deployment (Web Vitals, Sentry).

---

# 13. GraphQL Integration

- Using Apollo Client or Relay.
- Caching strategies and normalized cache.
- Optimistic UI updates for smoother user experience.

---

# 14. State Management Advanced Patterns

- Redux middleware: thunk, saga, observables.
- Normalizing large datasets for global state.
- Modular state slices using Zustand / Recoil.
- Combining local and global state efficiently.

---

# 15. Miscellaneous Practical Tips

- Scroll restoration between route changes.
- Handling file uploads and previews.
- Offline-first apps using service workers.
- Integrating third-party libraries safely in React apps.
