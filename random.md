# Key Concepts: REST APIs, Microservices, AI Tools, DSA, SQL & Databases

---

## 1. REST APIs

- **REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
- Uses HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
- Resources are identified by URLs (endpoints).
- Stateless communication: each request contains all necessary info.
- Uses JSON or XML for data exchange.
- Key principles: Uniform Interface, Statelessness, Cacheability, Layered System.

---

## 2. Microservices

- Architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services.
- Each microservice focuses on a single business capability.
- Services communicate over network protocols (usually HTTP/REST or messaging).
- Benefits: Scalability, Flexibility, Independent Deployment, Fault Isolation.
- Challenges: Complexity, Distributed system management, Data consistency.

## 3. AI Tools Experience

- **Copilot**: AI-powered code completion tool by GitHub.
- **Cursor AI**: AI assistant for code understanding and generation.
- Benefits: Boost productivity, code suggestions, error reduction.
- Usage: Integrated into IDEs to help write and refactor code faster.

## 4. Strong Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Skills

- Core for efficient problem-solving and coding interviews.
- Key topics:
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Trees, Graphs
  - Sorting & Searching algorithms
  - Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy algorithms
- Helps write optimized code with better time and space complexity.

## 5. SQL & Database Skills

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language) for managing relational databases.
- Core concepts:
  - Data querying: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`
  - Data manipulation: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
  - Schema management: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`
  - Constraints and indexing for data integrity and performance.
- Database types:
  - Relational (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  - NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)

# Summary

Mastering REST APIs and Microservices enables building scalable backend systems. Leveraging AI tools accelerates development. Strong DSA and SQL knowledge ensures writing efficient and reliable code, fundamental for high-quality software engineering.
