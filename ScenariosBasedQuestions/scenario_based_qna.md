# Scenario-Based Questions and Answers

## ðŸ”¹ Frontend (JavaScript)

### Q1: Memory Leak in Single Page Application (SPA)
**Answer:**  
If I notice memory leaks, Iâ€™d use Chrome DevToolsâ€™ Performance and Memory tabs to track heap snapshots. Common causes are event listeners not removed, timers left running, or large objects in state. Iâ€™d fix it by cleaning up listeners in `useEffect` cleanup in React, clearing intervals, and avoiding holding unnecessary references. Once patched, Iâ€™d rerun memory profiling to confirm garbage collection works correctly.

### Q2: Event Bubbling Issue
**Answer:**  
If a parent click is firing when I only want the childâ€™s action, Iâ€™d either call `event.stopPropagation()` in the child handler or restructure the event delegation. Sometimes using event delegation at the parent is intentional, so Iâ€™d carefully decide where events should propagate.

---

### Q3: Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Answer:**  
Iâ€™d reproduce the issue in the failing browser and check DevTools console for errors. Often itâ€™s unsupported features, so Iâ€™d use polyfills or transpilers like Babel. Iâ€™d also rely on tools like BrowserStack for testing and follow feature detection (`if ('fetch' in window)`) instead of user-agent checks.

### Q4: Slow Rendering in Large Table/Grid
**Answer:**  
I wouldnâ€™t render 10,000 rows at once. Instead, Iâ€™d implement virtualization using libraries like React Virtualized or windowing, which only render visible rows. Iâ€™d also paginate data and memoize components to reduce unnecessary re-renders. This way, performance improves drastically while still supporting large datasets.

---

### Q5: Security Issue â€“ XSS
**Answer:**  
To prevent XSS, Iâ€™d never render raw HTML from user input. Instead, Iâ€™d sanitize inputs using libraries like DOMPurify. On the backend, Iâ€™d enforce escaping in templates. Also, Iâ€™d add a Content Security Policy (CSP) to block inline scripts. That way, even malicious input wonâ€™t execute.

---

### Q6: Asynchronous Problem
**Answer:**  
If API calls finish in random order, Iâ€™d use `Promise.all` if theyâ€™re independent and need to resolve together. If order matters, Iâ€™d await each call sequentially. In React, Iâ€™d also guard against state updates after unmount to avoid race conditions.

---

### Q7: Debounce/Throttle Requirement
**Answer:**  
For search input firing too many requests, Iâ€™d use debounce so the API is only called after the user stops typing for, say, 300ms. For actions like window scroll events, Iâ€™d use throttle so the handler only runs at intervals. This reduces server load and improves UX.

---

### Q8: State Management Issue
**Answer:**  
If multiple components arenâ€™t syncing state properly, Iâ€™d centralize the state in a store like Redux, Zustand, or React Context. That way all dependent components get updates consistently. If itâ€™s performance heavy, Iâ€™d split state into smaller slices to reduce unnecessary re-renders.

## ðŸ”¹ Python

### Q1: Performance Bottleneck
**Answer:**  
If a script handling millions of records is too slow, Iâ€™d first profile with `cProfile` to find bottlenecks. Then Iâ€™d optimize by using vectorized operations with pandas or NumPy instead of loops, and add indexing for database queries. For extreme cases, Iâ€™d parallelize with multiprocessing or move heavy tasks to distributed systems like Spark.

---

### Q2: Memory Error with Large File
**Answer:**  
Iâ€™d avoid loading the entire file into memory. Instead, Iâ€™d stream data line by line with generators or `with open(...):`. For pandas, Iâ€™d use `chunksize` to process batches. If memory is still a problem, Iâ€™d store intermediate results in a database or use Dask for out-of-core processing.

---

### Q3: Concurrency for API Calls
**Answer:**  
To make 100 API calls faster, Iâ€™d switch from sequential requests to asynchronous ones using `asyncio` + `aiohttp`. If CPU-bound, Iâ€™d use multiprocessing. This way, calls can be made concurrently, drastically reducing total runtime.

---

### Q4: Debugging Flask/Django 500 Errors
**Answer:**  
Iâ€™d first check server logs and enable debug logging temporarily to capture stack traces. If logs are not enough, Iâ€™d reproduce the issue locally with the same environment variables. Common causes are migrations not applied, dependency mismatches, or misconfigured settings. Once fixed, Iâ€™d add error monitoring like Sentry to catch future issues earlier.

---

### Q5: Data Validation
**Answer:**  
Iâ€™d never assume incoming JSON is clean. Iâ€™d validate fields with libraries like Pydantic or Marshmallow, applying default values or rejecting bad data. This ensures downstream logic doesnâ€™t break because of unexpected inputs.

---

### Q6: Error Handling in Background Script
**Answer:**  
Iâ€™d wrap risky code in `try-except` blocks and log errors instead of crashing. For recurring tasks, Iâ€™d use retries with exponential backoff. If itâ€™s a long-running service, Iâ€™d add monitoring so failures are reported immediately.

---

### Q7: Testing Frequent Business Rule Changes
**Answer:**  
Iâ€™d write unit tests for the discount function with multiple cases, including edge cases. When business rules change, Iâ€™d update the test cases alongside the code. This way regression is caught quickly, and I can be confident the logic matches requirements.

---

### Q8: Legacy Code Maintainability
**Answer:**  
With a messy codebase, Iâ€™d start by writing tests around critical functionality to avoid breaking things. Then Iâ€™d refactor gradually: extract duplicate logic into functions, add docstrings, and apply linting/formatting. For larger projects, Iâ€™d also introduce type hints to improve readability and reduce bugs.
